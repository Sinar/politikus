# Politikus

Is a customized CMS based on Plone with add-ons and customizations for
investigative journalists and anti-corruption researchers to store and extract
bits of pieces of information on persons of interests, organizations and
contracts, using open data standards. It helps make this structured data
available in environments where such data is limited.

The base CMS platform functions as a flexible and user friendly way to
start an investigation, and then providing a way to store supporting
resources and sources, while extracting key metadata.

The metadata then provides additional insights into a story, such as
information on persons, their relations with each other, posts in
organizations, contratracts, related issues or red flags.

As the data and metadata is stored using open data standards of Popolo-spec,
OCDS, COST IDS and others, it can be exported, and also use other tools
developed by others using these standards.

# Installation and Configuration

TODO

This platform is in early stages of development, and better
